# EvaSDK Toolpath Converter

Really simple install, clone into the repo. Make install. Done.

Adds a right-click option to convert any saved/exported toolpath from the Choreograph interface into a pretty JSON file so you can edit it. Planning to add several other tools into this such as export text -> file, encode to base64 and add to clipboard.

# Currently MAC OS X ONLY
